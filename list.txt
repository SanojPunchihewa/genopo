1) Overlooking compiler flags when creating a CMake build configuration. e.g. not including the compiler flag -D FILE OFFSET BITS=64 in Minimap2 CMake build will result in file read failures.
2) Statically linking third party libraries that are used by more than one tool. e.g. Linking the static version of htslib library caused Samtools and F5C to fail.
3) Not Handling native exceptions in JNI interface
4) Not Handling native SIGSEGV signals and exit signals in JNI interface
5) Not Resetting command line argument vector before calling a new native function
